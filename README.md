## Math Tools

### Overview
This project builds some basic math functions for the calculus of series. 

### How to use it
Just import the mathtools module. Each function is described in the code comments.

#### Functions to be implemented: 
* `isPrime`: tells if a number is prime.
* `factorial`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
* `fib`: Calculates the n value of the fibonacci sequence.
* `geometric`: Calculates the sum of a geometric serie. 
* `arithmetic`: Calculates the sum of an arithmetic serie.
